-- PROJECT: XGE_DEF_MAC_DEF_PCS_PMA
--
-- SHORT DESCRIPTION: 10 GIGABIT ETHERNET EXAMPLE DESIGN (MAC+PHY, SINGLE PORT)
--
-- LONG DESCRIPTION: THIS IS AN EXAMPLE DESIGN GENERATED FROM XILINX VIVADO IP
--  CORE EXAMPLE DESIGN OF THE 10 GIGABIT ETHERNET PCS/PMA (PG068). THE PCS/PMA
--  LAYER WITHIN THE PROJECT IS THEN COUPLED WITH THE XILINX VIVADO IP CORE OF
--  THE 10 GIGABIT ETHERNET MAC (PG072).
--
--  ON TOP OF THE MAC LAYER IS A PACKET GENERATOR THAT GENERATES PACKETS WITH
--  DATA LENGTH OF N * 8 + 2 BYTES. AS THE MAC CORE IS GENERIC IN NATURE, IN
--  REAL, THE MAC LAYER HANDLES PACKET OF ALL SIZE AND PIGGY-TAIL PACKETS WITH
--  THE FRAME CHECK SEQUENCE (FCS), AKA, CRC CHECKSUM. THE MAC CORE HANDLES THE
--  COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL OF XGMII (10G MEDIA INDEPENDENT INTERFACE) LAYER THAT
--  BRIDGES THE MAC CORE AND THE SUPPORTING PCS/PMA PHYSICAL LAYER. THE PROTOCOL
--  FILLS THE XGMII TX/RX CHANNELS AROUND USER PACKET WITH XGMII ENCODING, E.G.,
--  '07' SIGNIFYING IDLE CHANNEL, 'FB' SIGNIFYING START OF A PACKET AND 'FD'
--  SIGNIFYING END OF PACKET FOR THE PHYSICAL CHANNEL TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN
--  REAL DATA AND IDLE CHANNEL THAT RESULTS IN HIGH-IMPEDANCE STATE IN PHYSICAL
--  LAYER LINK.
--
--  THIS EXAMPLE DESIGN IS CREATED FOR THE ALPHA DATA ADM-PCIE-7V3 THAT COMES
--  WITH 2 10GBE PORTS. IN ORDER TO SPECIFY THE 10GBE PORT TO OPERATE UPON,
--  UN/COMMENT THE CORRESPONDING PIN ASSIGNMENT LINES ASSOCIATED TO EACH PORT IN
--  THE CONSTRAINT FILE. TO OPERATE, CONSULT THE IMAGE "vio.png" INCLUDED IN THE
--  ASSOCIATED DIRECTORY "doc". THE SRC_ADDR CONFIGURES THE 10GBE PORTS MAC
--  ADDRESS. THE INPUT TAKES ONE FULL MAC ADDRESS, E.G., "000504030201" WILL
--  RESULT IN THE ASSIGNED PORT ADDRESSED AS "00:05:04:03:02:01".
--
--  THE DEST_ADDR SETS THE DESTINATION MAC ADDRESS THE ASSIGNED PORT IS
--  DELIVERING GENERATED PACKETS TO. THE STEP IN SENDING A SINGLE PACKET OUT
--  REQUIRES 1) SETTING PMA_RESET FROM HIGH TO LOW, THEN 2) SETTING PCS_RESET
--  FROM HIGH TO LOW AND FINALLY 3) SETTING "CTRL_VIO_N_3" THAT IS THE MASTER
--  RESET TOGGLE SWITCH FROM HIGH TO LOW. THEN, STS_PCS_LOCK, STS_PCS_PMA_LOCK,
--  STS_PCS_RX_LOCK AND STS_XPCS_RX_LINK_STATUS WILL BE HIGH. BY CLICKING THE
--  "IN_PULSE" SWITCH, A PACKET WILL BE GENERATED AND SENT OUT.
